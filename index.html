              <p class="thailandimgText">One of Krabi’s many pretty beaches, Railay Beach is especially photogenic. With the sparkling waters of the Andaman Sea to one side and dramatic jagged cliffs to the other, this little slice of white-sand paradise can only be reached by boat. Quiet and laid-back, the views are incredible. Long-tail boats bob on the waves, the calls of birds fill the air and monkeys swing through the dense foliage that clings to the rocks.
