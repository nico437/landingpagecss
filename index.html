With the sparkling waters of the Andaman Sea to one side and dramatic jagged cliffs to the other, this little slice of white-sand paradise can only be reached by boat. Quiet and laid-back, the views are incredible. Long-tail boats bob on the waves, the calls of birds fill the air and monkeys swing through the dense foliage that clings to the rocks.
